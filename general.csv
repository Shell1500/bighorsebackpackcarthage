What is the primary purpose of encryption?,To speed up data processing,To compress data for storage,To protect data confidentiality,To enable data sharing,C,Correct! The primary purpose of encryption is to protect data confidentiality. It ensures that data is only accessible to authorized parties.,Incorrect. The correct answer is to protect data confidentiality. Encryption ensures that only authorized individuals can access the data.
What is the recommended length for a secure password according to most cybersecurity experts?,6-8 characters,8-10 characters,12-16 characters,16-20 characters,C,Correct! The recommended length for a secure password is 12-16 characters. Longer passwords are more resistant to brute force attacks.,Incorrect. The correct answer is 12-16 characters. Cybersecurity experts recommend longer passwords for increased security.
Which type of attack exploits software vulnerabilities to execute malicious code?,Phishing,Exploit attack,Social engineering,Denial of Service (DoS),B,Correct! Exploit attacks exploit software vulnerabilities to execute malicious code. These attacks target specific weaknesses in software.,Incorrect. The correct answer is exploit attack. These attacks target specific vulnerabilities in software to execute malicious code.
What is the role of a firewall in network security?,To monitor network performance,To block unauthorized access while permitting outward communication,To store backup data,To encrypt data,B,Correct! A firewall blocks unauthorized access while permitting outward communication. It acts as a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted one.,Incorrect. The correct answer is to block unauthorized access while permitting outward communication. Firewalls serve as barriers between trusted and untrusted networks.
How often should employees change their passwords to maintain security?,Every 6 months,Every year,Every 3 months,Every 2 years,C,Correct! Employees should change their passwords every 3 months to maintain security. Regular changes reduce the risk of compromised passwords.,Incorrect. The correct answer is every 3 months. Changing passwords frequently reduces the risk of compromised security.
What is the primary benefit of using a VPN (Virtual Private Network)?,Faster internet speed,Increased privacy and security,Access to restricted websites,Improved data storage,B,"Correct!
